# ASSET - A super simple expense tracker
You can use this app to track your spendings. You can input your expenses, see a purchase history and a graph showing your account balance over time.

The main app is in app.py but you can put a rust proxy before it for logging purposes. Eventually I plan to rewrite everythin in rust.
